This involves the following steps:\n\n1. Instruction Construction:\n- Develop clear prompts to define the training purpose for the model.\n\n2. Teaching the Model:\n- Train the model with a representative example of the target pattern from the dataset.\n3. Evaluation of Teaching:\n- Assess the model's performance by testing it with another example and evaluating the results using a specified evaluation function.\n\n4. Pattern Categorization:\n- Identify and categorize the distinct patterns in the training dataset.\n- Research to find existing pattern categorizations.\n- Determine the suitability of different models for various patterns.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Prompts","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Instruction","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-27T03:27:08.714752Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-27T03:27:08.715101Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-27T03:27:08.719998Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-27T03:27:08.715074Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-27T03:27:08.718785Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]}]}
